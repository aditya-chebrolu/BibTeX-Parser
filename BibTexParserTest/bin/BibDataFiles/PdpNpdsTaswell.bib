To uphold established standards of scholarship, institutions should also consider one or more metrics of how appropriately an article cites relevant prior work. This paper describes the general characteristics of the FAIR Attribution to Indexed Reports (FAIR) family of metrics, which we have designed for this purpose. We formulate five FAIR metrics suitable for use with primary research articles. Two measure adherence to best practices: number of correctly attributed background statements and number of genuinely original claims. Three measure specific deviations from best practices: number of misattributed background statements, number of background statements with missing references, and number of claims falsely indicated as original. We conclude with a discussion of plans to implement a web application for calculating metric values of scholarly works described by records in Nexus-PORTAL-DOORS System (NPDS) servers.},

  abstract  = {We describe CoVaSEA (Concept-Validating Search Engine Agent): an automated web crawler/query engine that is interoperable with the Nexus-PORTAL-DOORS System. The Nexus-PORTAL-DOORS System (NPDS) is a data management system that organizes repositories of lexical metadata (in PORTAL servers) and semantic representations (in DOORS servers) of resources. Due to the purpose built hybridized nature of NPDS, it is well placed to perform a variety of data analysis tasks. However, many of these tasks require records of semantic descriptions which are labor intensive to create and maintain due to the substantial and rapidly increasing quantities of brain related literature available on the open web. To remedy this, we created CoVaSEA with the intention of providing an automated method for users to navigate and expand the semantic records of brain literature in the NPDS directories. To this end, CoVaSEA integrates multiple features which benefit NPDS including: (A) An implementation of SPARQL query based search to allow retrieval and manipulation of RDF descriptions, (B) Targeted web-crawling for relevant articles from external biomedical literature databases to broaden NPDS records, and (C) Translation of free-form text into RDF triples to derive the semantic portrayals of lexical data. CoVaSEA consists of three principal components: the web-crawler, the lexical to semantic converter, and the SPARQL query engine. The web crawler retrieves articles along with their basic metadata (title, abstract, author(s), etc.) from several of biomedical literature databases via REST API. However, in order to capture a full semantic description of the data in each article, key RDF triples which describe the abstract are constructed. First, each of the unique nouns in the passage are registered via coreference resolution and pronomial anaphora. Then the sentences are parsed into constituency tree format so that the subject(s), verb(s), and object(s) can be extracted. Once the SVO triples are extracted, they are transformed into valid RDF by assigning unique resource identifiers (URI) to each part of the triples. This is accomplished by using various databases (i.e. MeSH) for terminology and select named entities, word sense disambiguation for standard words, and literals for any other sections. These triples are stored via the Scribe API in either a DOORS directory or a localized triplestore where they can be retrieved via the SPARQL query engine. In order to create a more conducive user experience, the query engine supports the capability to construct SPARQL queries from expressions in conjunctive normal form, thus circumventing the need to know SPARQL syntax. With the distinct advantage that the system is automated, CoVaSEA presents the capability to search externally to furnish large numbers of brain-related literature descriptions on a regular basis and search internally to provide a method of retrieving those descriptions, thus laying the groundwork for a variety of future NPDS applications for which semantic metadata stores of brain literature are a functional necessity.},

As a distributed system of interacting PORTAL registries and DOORS directories, PDS provides metadata management services for who-what-where metadata about both online and offline resources. For the CTGaming PORTAL, the scope of the problem-oriented specialty domain for the registry encompasses gaming in physiotherapy, rehabilitation and intervention via telecare, and in general, diagnostic and therapeutic telegaming. This new PORTAL registry has also been incorporated into the design of an existing telegaming system (TGS). Operating as an adaptive gaming application for telerehabilitation, the TGS functions either locally in a clinical care setting or remotely in a telecare setting in patients' homes. Operating in concert with the TGS, the CTGaming PORTAL has been established as a host for metadata representations of resources in the field of clinical telegaming with metadata representations for resources relevant to the TGS served upon request. These resources may include external resources from the public web as well as internal resources such as telegaming session data from the private medical records associated with the TGS.},

It has not yet achieved the goals envisioned by its founders as a pervasive web of distributed knowledge and intelligence. Success will be attained when a dynamic synergism can be created between people and a sufficient number of infrastructure systems and tools for the semantic web in analogy with those for the original web. The domain name system (DNS), web browsers, and the benefits of publishing web pages motivated many people to register domain names and publish web sites on the original web. An analogous resource label system, semantic search applications, and the benefits of collaborative semantic networks will motivate people to register resource labels and publish resource descriptions on the semantic web. The Domain Ontology Oriented Resource System (DOORS) and Problem Oriented Registry of Tags and Labels (PORTAL) are proposed as infrastructure systems for resource metadata within a paradigm that can serve as a bridge between the original web and the semantic web. The Internet Registry Information Service (IRIS) registers domain names while DNS publishes domain addresses with mapping of names to addresses for the original web. Analogously, PORTAL registers resource labels and tags while DOORS publishes resource locations and descriptions with mapping of labels to locations for the semantic web. BioPORT is proposed as a prototype PORTAL registry specific for the problem domain of biomedical computing.},

In order to gain a better understanding of gene-brain-behavior relationships, improve treatment, and find cures for these diseases, translational research must be conducted with clinical trials of new drugs and other interventions followed by genotyping and imaging biomarkers for patients with these neuropyschiatric degenerative disorders. This research, involving pharmacogenomic molecular imaging of the brain, will be extremely costly in many ways. Therefore, knowledge engineering with effective software tools and applications built upon a semantic-enabled informatics infrastructure remains a necessary prerequisite to facilitate a reduction of those research costs by maximizing the benefit obtained from existing data and minimizing the cost of generating new data. A knowledge engineering framework that serves this goal must operate in a cross-disciplinary manner that integrates data from diverse biomedical fields while at the same time incorporating the relevant computational mathematics, statistics, and informatics analyses for productive data mining.},

  abstract  = {A registry for resources relevant to Clinical TeleGaming, called CTGaming, has been added as a new Problem-Oriented Registry of Tags And Labels (PORTAL) to the collection of prototype PORTAL registries for ongoing development of the PORTAL-DOORS System (PDS). As a distributed system of interacting PORTAL registries and DOORS directories, PDS provides management services for who-what-where metadata about both online and offline resources. For the CTGaming PORTAL, the scope of the problem-oriented specialty domain for the registry encompasses gaming in physiotherapy, rehabilitation and intervention via telecare, and in general, diagnostic and therapeutic telegaming. This new PORTAL registry has been created for use with an independent telegaming system (TGS). Operating as an adaptive gaming application, the TGS functions either locally in a clinical care setting or remotely in a telecare setting in patients' homes. Operating in concert with the TGS, the CTGaming PORTAL has been established as a host for metadata representations of resources in the field of clinical telegaming with metadata representations for resources relevant to the TGS served upon request.},
