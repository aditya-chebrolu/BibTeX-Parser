	requiring the interoperability of numerous diverse and distinct databases.
	The Semantic Web, through its standards, tools and languages, will
	give research labs, particularly bioinformatics labs, the ability
	to easily and automatically integrate across the varied biological
	databases. Although Berners-Lee eschewed proprietary standards in
	the creation of the web, favoring royalty free standards, there are
	still numerous legal concerns with regard to the standard setting
	process, particularly implications for antitrust and intellectual
	property law. This chapter will describe the social process of creating
	standards within academic science, and outline some of the legal
	concerns particularly related to antitrust and intellectual property
	issues, making some suggestions that might assist the regulation
	of difficulties of a legal nature in standardizing data and prevent
	a legal morass from arising out creating and setting standards for
	the Semantic Web.},

  abstract = {There are now more than a thousand Web Services offering access to
	disparate biological resources namely data and computational tools.
	It is extremely difficult for biological researchers to search in
	a Web Services (WS) registry for a relevant WS using the standard
	(primarily computational) descriptions used to describe it. Semantic
	Biological Web Services Registry (SemBOWSER) is an ontology-based
	implementation of the UDDI specification, which enables, at present,
	glycoproteomics researchers to publish, search and discover WS using
	semantic, service-level, descriptive domain keywords . SemBOWSER
	classifies a WS along two dimensions-- the task they implement and
	the domain they are associated with. Each published WS is associated
	with the relevant ProPreO (comprehensive process ontology for glycoproteomics
	experimental lifecycle) ontology-based keywords (implemented as part
	of the registry). A researcher, in turn, can search for relevant
	WS using only the descriptive keywords, part of their everyday working
	lexicon. This intuitive search is underpinned by the ProPreO ontology,
	thereby making use of the inherent advantages of a semantic search,
	as compared to a purely syntactic search, namely disambiguation and
	use of named relationships between concepts. SemBOWSER is part of
	the glycoproteomics web portal Stargate.},

  abstract = {The TAMBIS project aims to provide transparent access to disparate
	biological databases and analysis tools, enabling users to utilize
	a wide range of resources with the minimum of effort. A prototype
	system has been developed that includes a knowledge base of biological
	terminology (the biological Concept Model), a model of the underlying
	data sources (the Source Model) and a 'knowledge-driven' user interface.
	Biological concepts are captured in the knowledge base using a description
	logic called GRAIL. The Concept Model provides the user with the
	concepts necessary to construct a wide range of multiple-source queries,
	and the user interface provides a flexible means of constructing
	and manipulating those queries. The Source Model provides a description
	of the underlying sources and mappings between terms used in the
	sources and terms in the biological Concept Model. The Concept Model
	and Source Model provide a level of indirection that shields the
	user from source details, providing a high level of source transparency.
	Source independent, declarative queries formed from terms in the
	Concept Model are transformed into a set of source dependent, executable
	procedures. Query formulation, translation and execution is demonstrated
	using a working example.},

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: An ontology of biological terminology provides a model
	of biological concepts that can be used to form a semantic framework
	for many data storage, retrieval and analysis tasks. Such a semantic
	framework could be used to underpin a range of important bioinformatics
	tasks, such as the querying of heterogeneous bioinformatics sources
	or the systematic annotation of experimental results. RESULTS: This
	paper provides an overview of an ontology [the Transparent Access
	to Multiple Biological Information Sources (TAMBIS) ontology or TaO]
	that describes a wide range of bioinformatics concepts. The present
	paper describes the mechanisms used for delivering the ontology and
	discusses the ontology's design and organization, which are crucial
	for maintaining the coherence of a large collection of concepts and
	their relationships. AVAILABILITY: The TAMBIS system, which uses
	a subset of the TaO described here, is accessible over the Web via
	http://img.cs.man.ac.uk/tambis (although in the first instance, we
	will use a password mechanism to limit the load on our server). The
	complete model is also available on the Web at the above URL.},

	component in accurate modelling of molecular, cellular and organismal
	biology. Using the existing biomedical ontologies it has been impossible
	to capture the complexity of the community's knowledge about biological
	functions. RESULTS: We present here a top-level ontological framework
	for representing knowledge about biological functions. This framework
	lends greater accuracy, power and expressiveness to biomedical ontologies
	by providing a means to capture existing functional knowledge in
	a more formal manner. An initial major application of the ontology
	of functions is the provision of a principled way in which to curate
	functional knowledge and annotations in biomedical ontologies. Further
	potential applications include the facilitation of ontology interoperability
	and automated reasoning. A major advantage of the proposed implementation
	is that it is an extension to existing biomedical ontologies, and
	can be applied without substantial changes to these domain ontologies.
	AVAILABILITY: The Ontology of Functions (OF) can be downloaded in
	OWL format from http://onto.eva.mpg.de/. Additionally, a UML profile
	and supplementary information and guides for using the OF can be

In RDFPeers, both the neighbors per node and the routing hops for triple insertion, most query resolution and triple subscription are logarithmic to the network size.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The National Cancer Institute Thesaurus is described by
	its authors as "a biomedical vocabulary that provides consistent,
	unambiguous codes and definitions for concepts used in cancer research"
	and which "exhibits ontology-like properties in its construction
	and use". We performed a qualitative analysis of the Thesaurus in
	order to assess its conformity with principles of good practice in
	terminology and ontology design. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used both
	the on-line browsable version of the Thesaurus and its OWL-representation
	(version 04.08b, released on August 2, 2004), measuring each in light
	of the requirements put forward in relevant ISO terminology standards
	and in light of ontological principles advanced in the recent literature.
	RESULTS: We found many mistakes and inconsistencies with respect
	to the term-formation principles used, the underlying knowledge representation
	system, and missing or inappropriately assigned verbal and formal
	definitions. CONCLUSION: Version 04.08b of the NCI Thesaurus suffers
	from the same broad range of problems that have been observed in
	other biomedical terminologies. For its further development, we recommend
	the use of a more principled approach that allows the Thesaurus to
	be tested not just for internal consistency but also for its degree
	of correspondence to that part of reality which it is designed to
	represent.},

	The framework uses ontology as the conceptual backbone and adopts
	the service-oriented computing paradigm for information- and knowledge-level
	computation. We further present a semantics-based approach to problem
	solving, which exploits the rich semantic information of grid resource
	descriptions for resource discovery, instantiation, and composition.
	The framework and approach has been applied to a UK e-Science project
	- Grid Enabled Engineering Design Search and Optimisation in Engineering
	(GEODISE). An ontology-enabled problem solving environment (PSE)
	has been developed in GEODISE to leverage the semantic content of
	GEODISE resources and the Semantic Grid infrastructure for engineering
	design. Implementation and initial experimental results are reported.},

  abstract = {Developing cures for highly complex diseases, such as neurodegenerative disorders, requires extensive interdisciplinary collaboration and exchange of biomedical information in context. Our ability to exchange such information across sub-specialties today is limited by the current scientific knowledge ecosystem's inability to properly contextualize and integrate data and discourse in machine-interpretable form. This inherently limits the productivity of research and the progress toward cures for devastating diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. {SWAN} (Semantic Web Applications in Neuromedicine) is an interdisciplinary project to develop a practical, common, semantically structured, framework for biomedical discourse initially applied, but not limited, to significant problems in Alzheimer Disease ({AD}) research. The {SWAN} ontology has been developed in the context of building a series of applications for biomedical researchers, as well as in extensive discussions and collaborations with the larger bio-ontologies community. In this paper, we present and discuss the {SWAN} ontology of biomedical discourse. We ground its development theoretically, present its design approach, explain its main classes and their application, and show its relationship to other ongoing activities in biomedicine and bio-ontologies.},

	that is essential for almost all scientific collaboration, including

	This shortcoming limits our ability to integrate multiple knowledgebases,
	each of which gives partial information of a shared domain, as is
	commonly seen in bioinformatics. The Life Science Identifier (LSID)
	and LSID Resolution System (LSRS) provide simple and elegant solutions
	to this problem, based on the extension of existing internet technologies.
	LSID and LSRS are consistent with next-generation semantic web and
	semantic grid approaches. This article describes the syntax, operations,
	infrastructure compatibility considerations, use cases and potential
	future applications of LSID and LSRS. We see the adoption of these
	methods as important steps toward simpler, more elegant and more
	reliable integration of the world's biological knowledgebases, and

  abstract = {In this paper we introduce the knowledge representation features of
	a new multi-paradigm programming language called go! that cleanly
	integrates logic, functional, object oriented and imperative programming
	styles. Borrowing from L&O [1] go! allows knowledge to be represented
	as a set of labeled theories incrementally constructed using multiple-inheritance.
	The theory label is a constructor for instances of the class. The
	instances are Go!'s objects. A Go! theory structure can be used to
	characterize any knowledge domain. In particular, it can be used
	to describe classes of things, such as people, students, etc., their
	subclass relationships and characteristics of their key properties.
	That is, it can be used to represent an ontology. For each ontology
	class we give a type definition-we declare what properties, with
	what value type, instances of the class have-and we give a labeled
	theory that defines these properties. Subclass relationships are
	reflected using both type and theory inheritance rules. Following
	[2], we shall call this ontology oriented programming. This paper
	describes the Go! language and its use for ontology oriented programming,
	comparing its expressiveness with Owl, particularly Owl Lite[3].
	The paper assumes some familiarity with ontology specification using
	Owl like languages and with logic and object oriented programming.},

  abstract = {MOTIVATION:Sites with substantive bioinformatics operations are challenged
	to build data processing and delivery infrastructure that provides
	reliable access and enables data integration. Locally generated data
	must be processed and stored such that relationships to external
	data sources can be presented. Consistency and comparability across
	data sets requires annotation with controlled vocabularies and, further,
	metadata standards for data representation. Programmatic access to
	the processed data should be supported to ensure the maximum possible
	value is extracted. Confronted with these challenges at the National
	Cancer Institute Center for Bioinformatics, we decided to develop
	a robust infrastructure for data management and integration that
	supports advanced biomedical applications. RESULTS: We have developed
	an interconnected set of software and services called caCORE. Enterprise
	Vocabulary Services (EVS) provide controlled vocabulary, dictionary
	and thesaurus services. The Cancer Data Standards Repository (caDSR)
	provides a metadata registry for common data elements. Cancer Bioinformatics
	Infrastructure Objects (caBIO) implements an object-oriented model
	of the biomedical domain and provides Java, Simple Object Access
	Protocol and HTTP-XML application programming interfaces. caCORE
	has been used to develop scientific applications that bring together
	data from distinct genomic and clinical science sources. AVAILABILITY:
	caCORE downloads and web interfaces can be accessed from links on
	the caCORE web site (http://ncicb.nci.nih.gov/core). caBIO software
	is distributed under an open source license that permits unrestricted
	academic and commercial use. Vocabulary and metadata content in the
	EVS and caDSR, respectively, is similarly unrestricted, and is available
	through web applications and FTP downloads. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
	http://ncicb.nci.nih.gov/core/publications contains links to the
	caBIO 1.0 class diagram and the caCORE 1.0 Technical Guide, which

  pages = {52},
  volume = {2004},
  abstract = {We have developed an analysis toolbox called NUTMEG (Neurodynamic
	Utility Toolbox for Magnetoencephalography) for reconstructing the
	spatiotemporal dynamics of neural activations and overlaying them
	onto structural MR images. The toolbox runs under MATLAB in conjunction
	with SPM2 and can be used with the Linux/UNIX, Mac OS X, and even
	Windows platforms. Currently, evoked magnetic field data from 4-D
	Neuroimaging, CTF, and KIT systems can be imported to the toolbox
	for analysis. NUTMEG uses an eigenspace vector beamforming algorithm
	to generate a tomographic reconstruction of spatiotemporal magnetic
	source activity over selected time intervals and spatial regions.
	The MEG coordinate frame is coregistered with an anatomical MR image
	using fiducial locations and, optionally, head shape information.
	This allows the reconstruction to be superimposed onto an MRI to
	provide a convenient visual correspondence to neuroanatomy. Navigating
	through the MR volume automatically updates the displayed time series
	of activation for the selected voxel. Animations can also be generated
	to view the evolution of neural activity over time. Since NUTMEG
	displays activations using SPM2's engine, certain SPM functions such
	as brain rendering and spatial normalization may be applied as well.
	Finally, as a MATLAB package, the end user can easily add customized
	functions. Source code is available at http://bil.ucsf.edu/ and distributed
	under a BSD-style license.},

  abstract = {Both XLink and RDF provide a way of asserting relations between resources.
	RDF is primarily for describing resources and their relations, while
	XLink is primarily for specifying and traversing hyperlinks. However,
	the overlap between the two is sufficient that a mapping from XLink
	links to statements in an RDF model can be defined. Such a mapping
	allows XLink elements to be harvested as a source of RDF statements.
	XLink links (hereafter, "links") thus provide an alternate syntax
	for RDF information that may be useful in some situations. This Note
	specifies such a mapping, so that links can be harvested and RDF
	statements generated. The purpose of this harvesting is to create
	RDF models that, in some sense, represent the intent of the XML document.
	The purpose is not to represent the XLink structure in enough detail
	that a set of links could be round-tripped through an RDF model.},

	to solve this issue, this paper proposes a novel Semantic Web navigation
	model providing additional navigation paths through Swoogles search
	services such as the Ontology Dictionary. Using this model, we have
	developed algorithms for ranking the importance of Semantic Web objects
	at three levels of granularity: documents, terms and RDF graphs.
	Experiments show that Swoogle outperforms conventional web search
	engine and other ontology libraries in finding more ontologies, ranking
	their importance, and thus promoting the use and emergence of consensus
	ontologies.},

  abstract = {Web browsing involves two tasks: finding the right web page and then
	making sense of its content. So far, research has focused on supporting
	the task of finding web resources through ?standard? information
	retrieval mechanisms, or semantics-enhanced search. Much less attention
	has been paid to the second problem. In this paper we describe Magpie,
	a tool which supports the interpretation of web pages. Magpie offers
	complementary knowledge sources, which a reader can call upon to
	quickly gain access to any background knowledge relevant to a web
	resource. Magpie automatically associates an ontology-based semantic
	layer to web resources, allowing relevant services to be invoked
	within a standard web browser. Hence, Magpie may be seen as a step
	towards a semantic web browser. The functionality of Magpie is illustrated
	using examples of how it has been integrated with our lab?s web resources.},

	Semantic Web Services (SWSs) promise to provide solutions to the
	challenges associated with automated discovery, dynamic composition,

	systems. One of the barriers to a wider adoption of SWS technology
	is the lack of tools for creating SWS specifications. OWL-S is one
	of the major SWS description languages. This paper presents an OWL-S
	Editor, whose objective is to allow easy, intuitive OWL-S service
	development and to provide a variety of special-purpose capabilities

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: The lack of standards for storage and exchange of data
	is a serious hindrance for the large-scale data deposition, data
	mining and program interoperability that is becoming increasingly
	important in bioinformatics. The problem lies not only in defining
	and maintaining the standards, but also in convincing scientists
	and application programmers with a wide variety of backgrounds and
	interests to adhere to them. RESULTS: We present a UML-based programming
	framework for the modeling of data and the automated production of
	software to manipulate that data. Our approach allows one to make
	an abstract description of the structure of the data used in a particular
	scientific field and then use it to generate fully functional computer
	code for data access and input/output routines for data storage,
	together with accompanying documentation. This code can be generated
	simultaneously for different programming languages from a single
	model, together with, for example for format descriptions and I/O
	libraries XML and various relational databases. The framework is
	entirely general and could be applied in any subject area. We have
	used this approach to generate a data exchange standard for structural
	biology and analysis software for macromolecular NMR spectroscopy.
	AVAILABILITY: The framework is available under the GPL license, the
	data exchange standard with generated subroutine libraries under
	the LGPL license. Both may be found at http://www.ccpn.ac.uk; http://sourceforge.net/projects/ccpn

  abstract = {The Semantic Web for the Life Sciences (SWLS), when realized, will
	dramatically improve our ability to conduct bioinformatics analyses
	using the vast and growing stores of web-accessible resources. This
	ability will be achieved through the widespread acceptance and application
	of standards for naming, representing, describing and accessing biological
	information. The W3C-led Semantic Web initiative has established
	most, if not all, of the standards and technologies needed to achieve
	a unified, global SWLS. Unfortunately, the bioinformatics community
	has, thus far, appeared reluctant to fully adopt them. Rather, we
	are seeing what could be described as 'semantic creep'-timid, piecemeal
	and ad hoc adoption of parts of standards by groups that should be
	stridently taking a leadership role for the community. We suggest
	that, at this point, the primary hindrances to the creation of the
	SWLS may be social rather than technological in nature, and that,
	like the original Web, the establishment of the SWLS will depend
	primarily on the will and participation of its consumers.},

  abstract = {This paper describes the increasing role of ontologies in the context
	of Grid computing for obtaining, comparing and analyzing distributed
	heterogeneous scientific data. In the communities of people committed
	to a common goal, the management of resources and services becomes
	very important. We chose the application domain of human disease
	research and control. A characteristic of the domain is that trusted
	databases exist but their schemas are often poorly or not documented.
	The network of biomedical databases forms a loose federation of autonomous,
	distributed, heterogeneous data repositories ripe for information
	integration. Grid services will provide a dynamic way to use resources
	in such a large distributed scientific environment while the use
	of ontology enables the system to carryout reasoning at 3 levels:
	a) available information in all Bio-Databases (Grid nodes) worldwide,
	b) reasoning about the retrievable information from each node, c)
	reasoning about the retrieved information and presenting it in a
	meaningful format for users. We adopted the ontology design methodology
	of DOGMA and developed Generic Human Disease Ontology (GenDO) that
	contains common general information regarding human diseases. The
	information is represented in 4 "dimensions": (a) disease types,
	(b) causes (c) symptoms and (d) treatments. We illustrate how this
	GenDO helps to produce Specific Human Disease Ontologies (SpeDO)
	on request. We show how the combination of two different but complementary
	techniques, namely Grid computing and ontology, results in a dynamic

  abstract = {We are developing the Neurological Disease Ontology ({ND}) to provide a framework to enable representation of aspects of neurological diseases that are relevant to their treatment and study. {ND} is a representational tool that addresses the need for unambiguous annotation, storage, and retrieval of data associated with the treatment and study of neurological diseases. {ND} is being developed in compliance with the Open Biomedical Ontology Foundry principles and builds upon the paradigm established by the Ontology for General Medical Science ({OGMS}) for the representation of entities in the domain of disease and medical practice. Initial applications of {ND} will include the annotation and analysis of large data sets and patient records for Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, and stroke. {ND} is implemented in OWL 2 and currently has more than 450 terms that refer to and describe various aspects of neurological diseases. {ND} directly imports the development version of OGMS, which uses BFO 2. Term development in {ND} has primarily extended the {OGMS} terms 'disease', 'diagnosis', 'disease course', and 'disorder'. We have imported and utilize over 700 classes from related ontology efforts including the Foundational Model of Anatomy, Ontology for Biomedical Investigations, and Protein Ontology. {ND} terms are annotated with ontology metadata such as a label (term name), term editors, textual definition, definition source, curation status, and alternative terms (synonyms). Many terms have logical definitions in addition to these annotations. Current development has focused on the establishment of the upper-level structure of the {ND} hierarchy, as well as on the representation of Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, and stroke. The ontology is available as a version-controlled file at http://code.google.com/p/neurological-disease-ontology along with a discussion list and an issue tracker. {ND} seeks to provide a formal foundation for the representation of clinical and research data pertaining to neurological diseases. {ND} will enable its users to connect data in a robust way with related data that is annotated using other terminologies and ontologies in the biomedical domain.},

	share many common characteristics. It is believed that the combination
	of the two emerging techniques is a very promising method in promoting
	the web services (WS). Because the service discovery plays a key
	role in the integration, here a P2P-based framework to manage the
	knowledge of service and locating services is proposed. In this paper,
	the details of the principle, constructing and maintaining of service
	semantic overlay architecture have been described, and the way how
	the semantic overlay facilitates discovery of service resources is
	illustrated. To enable the semantic web service superiority, Service
	Ontology, which is considered as the service semantic model, is employed
	to depict service. The service discovery includes two phases: searching
	on the service semantic overlay; and local discovery in peer's service
	repository. Various solutions have been proposed to realize those
	two phases. Furthermore, tests are carried out to evaluate service
	discovery on the architecture.},

	relational Database Management Systems, which provide standard interfaces
	like JDBC and ODBC for data and metadata exchange. By using these
	interfaces, many technical problems of database integration vanish
	and issues related to semantics remain, e.g. the use of different
	terms for the same things, different names for equivalent database
	attributes and missing links between relevant entries in different
	databases. RESULTS: In this publication, principles and methods that
	were used to implement SEMEDA (Semantic Meta Database) are described.
	Database owners can use SEMEDA to provide semantically integrated
	access to their databases as well as to collaboratively edit and
	maintain ontologies and controlled vocabularies. Biologists can use
	SEMEDA to query the integrated databases in real time without having
	to know the structure or any technical details of the underlying
	databases. AVAILABILITY: SEMEDA is available at http://www-bm.ipk-gatersleben.de/semeda/.
	Database providers who intend to grant access to their databases

  title = {Linking experimental results, biological networks and sequence analysis methods using Ontologies and Generalised Data Structures.},
  number = {1},
  pages = {33--44},
  volume = {5},
  abstract = {The structure of a closely integrated data warehouse is described
	that is designed to link different types and varying numbers of biological
	networks, sequence analysis methods and experimental results such
	as those coming from microarrays. The data schema is inspired by
	a combination of graph based methods and generalised data structures
	and makes use of ontologies and meta-data. The core idea is to consider
	and store biological networks as graphs, and to use generalised data
	structures (GDS) for the storage of further relevant information.
	This is possible because many biological networks can be stored as
	graphs: protein interactions, signal transduction networks, metabolic
	pathways, gene regulatory networks etc. Nodes in biological graphs
	represent entities such as promoters, proteins, genes and transcripts
	whereas the edges of such graphs specify how the nodes are related.
	The semantics of the nodes and edges are defined using ontologies
	of node and relation types. Besides generic attributes that most
	biological entities possess (name, attribute description), further
	information is stored using generalised data structures. By directly
	linking to underlying sequences (exons, introns, promoters, amino
	acid sequences) in a systematic way, close interoperability to sequence
	analysis methods can be achieved. This approach allows us to store,
	query and update a wide variety of biological information in a way
	that is semantically compact without requiring changes at the database
	schema level when new kinds of biological information is added. We
	describe how this datawarehouse is being implemented by extending
	the text-mining framework ONDEX to link, support and complement different
	bioinformatics applications and research activities such as microarray
	analysis, sequence analysis and modelling/simulation of biological
	systems. The system is developed under the GPL license and can be

	features of semantic database integration and text mining with methods
	for graph-based analysis. An overview of the ONDEX system is presented,
	concentrating on recently developed features for graph-based analysis
	and visualization. A case study is used to show how ONDEX can help
	to identify causal relationships between stress response genes and

	functional annotations for most of the genes that emerged as significant
	in the microarray experiment, but were previously of unknown function.},

  abstract = {Life science research is becoming evermore computationally intensive.
	Hence, from a computational resource perspective, Grid computing
	provides a logical approach to meeting many of the computational
	needs of life science research. However, there are several barriers
	to the widespread use of Grid computing in life sciences. In this
	paper, we attempt to address one particular barrier: the difficulty
	of using Grid computing by life scientists. Life science research
	often involves connecting multiple applications together to form
	a workflow. This process of constructing a workflow is complex. When
	combined with the difficulty of using Grid services, composing a
	meaningful workflow using Grid services can present a challenge to
	life scientists. Our proposed solution is a Semantic Web-enabled
	computing environment, called Bio-STEER. In Bio-STEER, bioinformatics
	Grid services are mapped to Semantic Web services, described in OWL-S.
	We also defined an ontology in OWL to model bioinformatics applications.
	A graphical user interface helps to construct a scientific workflow
	by showing a list of services that are semantically sound; that is,
	the output of one service is semantically compatible with the input
	of the connecting service. Bio-STEER can help users take full advantage
	of Grid services through a user-friendly graphical user interface
	(GUI), which allows them to easily construct the workflows they need.},

In addition, our model incorporates a grouping strategy to take into consideration the coordinating structure among entities co-occurred in one sentence. We apply our approach to extract gene expression relationship between genes and brain regions from literature. Results show that our methods can achieve promising performance over baselines of Transductive Support Vector Machine and with non-grouping strategy.},

	of several services. The Semantic Web forms a new scenario, where
	advanced methods and techniques are developed for the description,

	this study proposes an approach for binding the "semantic" facet
	with the usual textual one, that together constitutes a typical web
	page, or specifically, a semantic web document. Through the use of
	unsupervised learning, we offer a new alternative of organizing web
	documents which emphasizes a direct separation between the syntactic
	and semantic facets of the web information. In this study, we discuss
	a collaborative proximity-based fuzzy clustering and show how this
	type of clustering is used to discover a structure of web information
	by a prudent reliance on the structures in the spaces of semantics
	and data. The method focuses on the reconciliation between the two
	separated facets of web information and a combination of results
	leading to a comprehensive data organization. The information arranged
	in this manner can provide an integral description of web resources,
	becoming in this manner an essential technique for the next generation

The Prot{\'e}g{\'e} {OWL} editor was used as a tool for building {ADO} in Ontology Web Language format. Results {ADO} was developed with the purpose of containing information relevant to four main biological views---preclinical, clinical, etiological, and molecular/cellular mechanisms---and was enriched by adding synonyms and references. Validation of the lexicalized ontology by means of named entity recognition-based methods showed a satisfactory performance (F score = 72%). In addition to structural and functional evaluation, a clinical expert in the field performed a manual evaluation and curation of ADO. Through integration of {ADO} into an information retrieval environment, we show that the ontology supports semantic search in scientific text. The usefulness of {ADO} is authenticated by dedicated use case scenarios. Conclusions Development of {ADO} as an open {ADO} is a first attempt to organize information related to Alzheimer's disease in a formalized, structured manner. We demonstrate that {ADO} is able to capture both established and scattered knowledge existing in scientific text.},

BioPortal functionality includes the ability to browse, search and visualize ontologies. The Web interface also facilitates community-based participation in the evaluation and evolution of ontology content by providing features to add notes to ontology terms, mappings between terms and ontology reviews based on criteria such as usability, domain coverage, quality of content, and documentation and support. BioPortal also enables integrated search of biomedical data resources such as the Gene Expression Omnibus ({GEO}), ClinicalTrials.gov, and ArrayExpress, through the annotation and indexing of these resources with ontologies in BioPortal. Thus, BioPortal not only provides investigators, clinicians, and developers 'one-stop shopping' to programmatically access biomedical ontologies, but also provides support to integrate data from a variety of biomedical resources.},

	Recent research, however, shows that the semantics of the standard

	compatible with each other. This paper investigates some issues behind
	this incompatibility and proposes a novel modification of RDF(S)
	as a firm semantic foundation for many of the latest Description
	Logics-based SW ontology languages, including OWL DL. Furthermore,
	the bidirectional one-to-one mapping between RDFS(FA) axioms in strata
	0-2 and OWL DL axioms has been established, which enables RDFS(FA)-agents
	and OWL DL-agents to communicate with each other more easily. As
	a result, the introduction of RDFS(FA) clarifies the vision of the

	cooperation by sharing knowledge. To achieve this goal, the
	emerging Semantic Web community has proposed ontologies
	to express knowledge in a machine understandable way.
	The process of building and maintaining ontologies, which is
	known as Ontology Engineering, presents unique challenges.
	These challenges are related to lack of trustworthy and authoritative
	knowledge sources and absence of a centralized
	repository to locate ontologies to be reused. In this paper,
	we propose a Semantic Web portal, called OntoKhoj that is
	designed to simplify the Ontology Engineering process. The
	methodology in developing OntoKhoj is based on algorithms
	used for searching, aggregating, ranking and classifying ontologies
	in Semantic Web. The proposed OntoKhoj would
	1) allow agents and ontology engineers to retrieve trustworthy,
	authoritative knowledge, and 2) expedite the process
	of ontology engineering through extensive reuse of ontologies.
	We have implemented the OntoKhoj portal and further
	validated our system on the real ontological data in the
	Semantic Web.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Robust, programmatically accessible biomedical information
	services that syntactically and semantically interoperate with other
	resources are challenging to construct. Such systems require the
	adoption of common information models, data representations and terminology
	standards as well as documented application programming interfaces
	(APIs). The National Cancer Institute (NCI) developed the cancer
	common ontologic representation environment (caCORE) to provide the
	infrastructure necessary to achieve interoperability across the systems
	it develops or sponsors. The caCORE Software Development Kit (SDK)
	was designed to provide developers both within and outside the NCI
	with the tools needed to construct such interoperable software systems.
	RESULTS: The caCORE SDK requires a Unified Modeling Language (UML)
	tool to begin the development workflow with the construction of a
	domain information model in the form of a UML Class Diagram. Models
	are annotated with concepts and definitions from a description logic
	terminology source using the Semantic Connector component. The annotated
	model is registered in the Cancer Data Standards Repository (caDSR)
	using the UML Loader component. System software is automatically
	generated using the Codegen component, which produces middleware
	that runs on an application server. The caCORE SDK was initially
	tested and validated using a seven-class UML model, and has been
	used to generate the caCORE production system, which includes models
	with dozens of classes. The deployed system supports access through
	object-oriented APIs with consistent syntax for retrieval of any
	type of data object across all classes in the original UML model.
	The caCORE SDK is currently being used by several development teams,
	including by participants in the cancer biomedical informatics grid
	(caBIG) program, to create compatible data services. caBIG compatibility
	standards are based upon caCORE resources, and thus the caCORE SDK
	has emerged as a key enabling technology for caBIG. CONCLUSION: The
	caCORE SDK substantially lowers the barrier to implementing systems
	that are syntactically and semantically interoperable by providing
	workflow and automation tools that standardize and expedite modeling,
	development, and deployment. It has gained acceptance among developers
	in the caBIG program, and is expected to provide a common mechanism
	for creating data service nodes on the data grid that is under development.},

Systematic literature reviews, meta-analyses of published data, and meta-analyses of individual data (pooled reanalyses) are now being published with increasing frequency. We here describe the essential features of these methods and discuss their strengths and weaknesses. METHODS: This article is based on a selective literature search. The different types of review and meta-analysis are described, the methods used in each are outlined so that they can be evaluated, and a checklist is given for the assessment of reviews and meta-analyses of scientific articles. RESULTS: Systematic literature reviews provide an overview of the state of research on a given topic and enable an assessment of the quality of individual studies. They also allow the results of different studies to be evaluated together when these are inconsistent. Meta-analyses additionally allow calculation of pooled estimates of an effect. The different types of review and meta-analysis are discussed with examples from the literature on one particular topic. CONCLUSIONS: Systematic literature reviews and meta-analyses enable the research findings and treatment effects obtained in different individual studies to be summed up and evaluated.},

  abstract = {Although medical centres have established boards, special committees, and offices for the review and redress of breaches in ethical behaviour, these mechanisms repeatedly prove themselves ineffective in addressing research misconduct within the institutions of academic medicine. As the authors see it, institutional design: (1) systematically ignores serious ethical problems, (2) makes whistleblowers into institutional enemies and punishes them, and (3) thereby fails to provide an ethical environment.
	The authors present and discuss cases of academic medicine failing to address unethical behaviour in academic science and, thereby, illustrate the scope and seriousness of the problem. The Olivieri/Apotex affair is just another instance of academic medicine’s dereliction in a case of scientific fraud and misconduct. Instead of vigorously supporting their faculty member in her efforts to honestly communicate her findings and to protect patients from the risks associated with the use of the study drug, the University of Toronto collaborated with the Apotex company’s “stalling tactics,” closed down Dr Olivieri’s laboratory, harassed her, and ultimately dismissed her.
	The authors argue that the incentives for addressing problematic behaviour have to be revised in order to effect a change in the current pattern of response that occurs in academic medicine. An externally imposed realignment of incentives could convert the perception of the whistleblower, from their present caste as the enemy within, into a new position, as valued friend of the institution. The authors explain how such a correction could encourage appropriate reactions to scientific misconduct from academic medicine.},

  abstract = {The increasing number of ontologies on the Web and the
	appearance of large scale ontology repositories has brought
	the topic of ontology selection in the focus of the semantic
	web research agenda. Our view is that ontology evaluation
	is core to ontology selection and that, because ontology selection
	is performed in an open Web environment, it brings
	new challenges to ontology evaluation.
	Unfortunately, current research regards ontology selection
	and evaluation as two separate topics. Our goal in this paper
	is to explore how these two tasks relate. In particular, we
	are interested to get a better understanding of the ontology
	selection task and filter out the challenges that it brings to
	ontology evaluation. We discuss requirements posed by the
	open Web environment on ontology selection, we overview
	existing work on selection and point out future directions.
	Our major conclusion is that, even if selection methods still
	need further development, they have already brought novel
	approaches to ontology evaluation.},

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: The complexity of cancer is prompting researchers to find
	new ways to synthesize information from diverse data sources and
	to carry out coordinated research efforts that span multiple institutions.
	There is a need for standard applications, common data models, and
	software infrastructure to enable more efficient access to and sharing
	of distributed computational resources in cancer research. To address
	this need the National Cancer Institute (NCI) has initiated a national-scale
	effort, called the cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid (caBIGtrade
	mark), to develop a federation of interoperable research information
	systems. RESULTS: At the heart of the caBIG approach to federated
	interoperability effort is a Grid middleware infrastructure, called
	caGrid. In this paper we describe the caGrid framework and its current
	implementation, caGrid version 0.5. caGrid is a model-driven and
	service-oriented architecture that synthesizes and extends a number
	of technologies to provide a standardized framework for the advertising,
	discovery, and invocation of data and analytical resources. We expect
	caGrid to greatly facilitate the launch and ongoing management of
	coordinated cancer research studies involving multiple institutions,
	to provide the ability to manage and securely share information and
	analytic resources, and to spur a new generation of research applications
	that empower researchers to take a more integrative, trans-domain
	approach to data mining and analysis. AVAILABILITY: The caGrid version
	0.5 release can be downloaded from https://cabig.nci.nih.gov/workspaces/Architecture/caGrid/.
	The operational test bed Grid can be accessed through the client
	included in the release, or through the caGrid-browser web application
	http://cagrid-browser.nci.nih.gov.},

Martial is the first classical poet to use the term plagiarius to refer to literary theft ("Ep." 1.52), and elsewhere in his epigrams, he frequently accuses other poets of appropriating or copying his work. This article argues that Martial's explicit references to plagiarism illustrate a poetic self-identity invested in the materiality of his texts: as Martial objectifies his books, he also commodifies them as articles of the marketplace. By defining his poetry as material commodities available for purchase or theft, Martial also exposes the economic fictions of Roman literary patronage.},

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: A Robot Scientist is a physically implemented robotic
	system that can automatically carry out cycles of scientific experimentation.
	We are commissioning a new Robot Scientist designed to investigate
	gene function in S. cerevisiae. This Robot Scientist will be capable
	of initiating >1,000 experiments, and making >200,000 observations
	a day. Robot Scientists provide a unique test bed for the development
	of methodologies for the curation and annotation of scientific experiments:
	because the experiments are conceived and executed automatically
	by computer, it is possible to completely capture and digitally curate
	all aspects of the scientific process. This new ability brings with
	it significant technical challenges. To meet these we apply an ontology
	driven approach to the representation of all the Robot Scientist's
	data and metadata. RESULTS: We demonstrate the utility of developing
	an ontology for our new Robot Scientist. This ontology is based on
	a general ontology of experiments. The ontology aids the curation
	and annotating of the experimental data and metadata, and the equipment
	metadata, and supports the design of database systems to hold the
	data and metadata. AVAILABILITY: EXPO in XML and OWL formats is at:
	http://sourceforge.net/projects/expo/. All materials about the Robot
	Scientist project are available at: http://www.aber.ac.uk/compsci/Research/bio/robotsci/.},

	World Wide Web resources. It is used to represent, among other things,
	personal information, social networks, metadata about digital artifacts,

	of information. A standardized query language for RDF data with multiple
	implementations offers developers and end users a way to write and

	Used with a common protocol, applications can access and combine
	information from across the Web.
	This document describes the query language part of the SPARQL Protocol
	And RDF Query Language for easy access to RDF stores. It is designed
	to meet the requirements and design objectives described in RDF Data
	Access Use Cases and Requirements [UCNR]. The SPARQL query language
	consists of the syntax and semantics for asking and answering queries
	against RDF graphs. SPARQL contains capabilities for querying by
	triple patterns, conjunctions, disjunctions, and optional patterns.
	It also supports constraining queries by source RDF graph and extensible
	value testing. Results of SPARQL queries can be ordered, limited
	and offset in number, and presented in several different forms.},

Most of us willingly accept the responsibilities that come with being a reviewer but how comfortable are we with the process? Peer review is open to abuse but how should it be policed and can it be improved? A bad peer review process can inadvertently ruin an individual’s career, but are there penalties for policing a reviewer who deliberately sabotages a manuscript or grant? Science has received an increasingly tainted name because of recent high profile cases of alleged scientific misconduct. Once considered the results of work stress or a temporary mental health problem, scientific misconduct is increasingly being reported and proved to be a repeat offence. How should scientific misconduct be handled—is it a criminal offence and subject to national or international law? Similarly plagiarism is an ever-increasing concern whether at the level of the student or a university president. Are the existing laws tough enough? These issues, with appropriate examples, are dealt with in this review.},

	Additionally, we represent the information relevant for the discovery
	process using Bloom filters and pre-computed matching information
	such that search efforts are minimized when querying for services
	with a certain functional/QoS profile. Query results can be ranked
	and users can provide feedbacks on the actual QoS provided by a service.
	To evaluate the credibility of these user reports when predicting
	service quality, we include a robust trust and reputation management
	mechanism.},

A diverse set of stakeholders — representing academia, industry, funding agencies, and scholarly publishers — have come together to design and jointly endorse a concise and measureable set of principles that we refer to as the FAIR Data Principles. The intent is that these may act as a guideline for those wishing to enhance the reusability of their data holdings. Distinct from peer initiatives that focus on the human scholar, the FAIR Principles put specific emphasis on enhancing the ability of machines to automatically find and use the data, in addition to supporting its reuse by individuals. This Comment is the first formal publication of the FAIR Principles, and includes the rationale behind them, and some exemplar implementations in the community.},

	supplementation of traditional journal publications, allowing access
	to resources, such as video, sound, software, databases, datasets
	too large to publish, and even supplementary information and discussion.
	However, unlike traditional publications, continued availability
	of these online resources is not guaranteed. An automated survey
	was conducted to quantify the growth in Uniform Resource Locators
	(URLs) published to date in MEDLINE abstracts, their current availability
	and distribution by journal. RESULTS: Of 1630 unique URLs identified,
	formatting and/or spelling errors were detected within 201 (12%)
	of them as published. After corrections were made, a survey revealed
	that approximately 63% of these URLs were consistently available,
	and another 19% were available intermittently. The rate of failure
	was far worse for anonymous login to FTP sites, with only 12 of 33
	sites (36%) responding. This survey also shows that journals vary
	disproportionately in the number of web citations published, suggesting
	policy implementation among a few could have a profound impact overall.
	Out of the 306 journals with a URL published in an abstract, Bioinformatics
	published the most (12% of total). AVAILABILITY: URL database and
	program available by request.},

	have been proposed. Most of them, however, focus on classifying the

	result. In this paper, a new method of semantic matchmaker is proposed
	for ranking web services. It is proposed to use the semantic distance
	for estimating the matching degree between a service and a user request.
	Four types of semantic distances are defined and four algorithms
	are implemented respectively to calculate them. Experimental results
	show that the proposed semantic matchmaker significantly outperforms
	the keyword-based baseline method.},

  abstract = {There is huge amount of biomedical and biological literature online or in digital libraries. Moreover, new research papers are published with an exponential growth in recent years. So it is pressing and challenging to mine meaningful topics from massive biomedical literature. The mined topics are helpful to researchers for literature exploration and topic discovery. However, latent topics inferred by traditional topic models are not always coherent and meaningful. In this work, we propose a new methodology to mine meaningful biomedical topics with a combination of several off-the-shelf text mining techniques such as part-of-speech tagging, base noun phrase chunking, K-means clustering and latent Dirichlet allocation, which endow our methodology with scalability and implementation simplicity. We conduct comprehensive experiments on a dataset collected from PubMed. The experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms a baseline method. We also perform a qualitative analysis and present meaningful biomedical topics and multi-word expressions.},
